# Why?

As k8s seem complex (see [k8s-playground](https://github.com/jacekbilski/k8s-playground)), switching to a simpler alternative - Docker Swarm. Goal stays the same - get a feeling what that is, what it can do and some basics of using it.

## General stuff

### Running swarm

First: install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Then initialize the swarm with simple `docker swarm init`.
